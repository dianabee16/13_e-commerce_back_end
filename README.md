## [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this project we built the back end of an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I've configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
For installing the application you will need to clone the repo into your local machine. To get started you can run `npm install` in the integrated terminal to install packages. After that, you will need to create a .env file and insert your own MySQL credentials. Then run mysql in your CLI to source the schema. Finally, you will need to run `npm run seed` to seed the database. Then, invoke the database with `node server.js`.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
Once packages are installed, in order to test the routes you will need Insomnia, Postman or a similar program. You would reference the models and seed data for how to structure the JSON reponses to make new entries.
